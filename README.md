I am a Full Stack .NET Developer and Programming Teacher with solid experience building enterprise web applications, APIs, and business-critical systems, as well as teaching programming and computer science fundamentals to a large and diverse audience.

Throughout my career, I have worked on the development, implementation, and maintenance of web applications and RESTful APIs using C#, ASP.NET (MVC and Razor Pages), JavaScript, and SQL Server, applying object-oriented principles, layered architectures, and well-structured business logic. My experience includes system integrations, payment gateway integrations (SiTef), asynchronous front-end communication using Fetch API and AJAX, and data export and reporting solutions (Excel/XLSX).

I have strong experience handling complex business rules, performing CRUD operations with a focus on data consistency, performance, and scalability, and working with both modern and legacy .NET applications. I am comfortable with database modeling, query optimization, and performance tuning in SQL Server, always prioritizing reliability, maintainability, and clean architecture.

In addition to my development career, I have over 8 years of experience as a Programming Teacher, during which I have trained more than 30,000 students of all ages, both in-person and online. I have created and continuously improved custom curricula, teaching modules, and hands-on projects, covering topics such as programming fundamentals, web development, application logic, and software engineering best practices. I have also developed and maintained internal school systems and educational platforms, directly connecting teaching activities with real-world software development.

My background allows me to bridge theory and practice, translating complex technical concepts into clear, structured learning experiences, while applying strong didactic skills to team communication, technical documentation, and system development.

I am currently seeking opportunities as a Full Stack Developer, preferably in remote or hybrid environments, and I am also open to teaching positions in higher education, technical programs, or online learning platforms focused on programming and software development.
